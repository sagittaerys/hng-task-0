              <p>
                I'm a full-stack engineer with strong leanings toward front end
                development. I love writing code because it's the closest thing
                that we have to magical runes in the modern world [I'm a
                mythological geek so......] and this feeling of making it all
                click is kinda addictive tbh.
              </p>

              <p>
                When I'm not coding, you'll find me lost in a good book,
                exploring historical or mythological cannons.
              </p>

              <p>
                I believe in continuous learning and growth, both personally and
                professionally.
              </p>

              <p>P.S - For the second time, I make a mean jollof rice fr ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.</p>

            <h2>Note to My Future Self</h2>

            <p id="salutations">Dear Future Me,</p>

            <p>
              It's funny now that I'm writing this out because the concept of self-authoring has been put forward to me by a role model of mine but I never sat still to actually pour out my feelings. 

              Here's my note to the future me, I hope you become as great as I envision you to be. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
              The doubts, the fears, the uncertainties you're feeling right now are all part of the journey we lazily decided to call 'Life'. Remember, every expert was once a beginner who dared to take that first step.
            </p>

            <p>
              Did you finally initiate "Project Demeter"? I hope you did because it's high time we carved out our own place in the world. Remember, the world needs more dreamers who do.
            </p>

            <p>
             Here's to the certainty that you'll always commit yourself to the highest good you can attain while making our life, our family and our society better. This is more for me at this moment in time because I know the universe is gonna keep testing our resolve. Stay strong, stay curious, and most importantly, stay true to yourself.
            </p>

            <p>
             P.S - Remember, it's not up to you to make everyone happy. Do not lose yourself trying to be everything to everyone. Your worth is not defined by others' opinions of you.

            <h3>What I Love About Web Development?</h3>
            <p>
              At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I love writing code because it's the closest thing that we have to magical runes in the modern world. Codes are like runes that, when combined in the right way, can create powerful and transformative experiences on the web. The ability to bring ideas to life, solve problems, and create interactive and engaging user experiences is what draws me to web development.

              I've been reading a little too much of mythology and high fantasy recently, haven't I? ðŸ˜‚
